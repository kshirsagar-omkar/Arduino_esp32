Given that you have plenty of space available on /dev/sda5 and /dev/sda2, you can move your .arduino15 directory to one of these partitions to free up space on your root filesystem (/dev/sdb5). Here’s how you can do it:

Steps to Move .arduino15 to /dev/sda5 or /dev/sda2
Create a Directory on the Target Partition:

Choose either /dev/sda5 or /dev/sda2 as your target. In this example, we'll use /dev/sda5.
Create a directory on the target partition to store your .arduino15 data.
bash
Copy code
mkdir -p /media/vaibhav/Local\ Disk/arduino_backup
Move the .arduino15 Directory:

Move the .arduino15 directory to the newly created directory.
bash
Copy code
mv /home/vaibhav/.arduino15 /media/vaibhav/Local\ Disk/arduino_backup/
Create a Symbolic Link:

Create a symbolic link from the original location to the new location so that the applications can still find the .arduino15 directory in its original place.
bash
Copy code
ln -s /media/vaibhav/Local\ Disk/arduino_backup/.arduino15 /home/vaibhav/.arduino15
Detailed Commands
Create a Backup Directory:

bash
Copy code
mkdir -p /media/vaibhav/Local\ Disk/arduino_backup
Move .arduino15 Directory:

bash
Copy code
mv /home/vaibhav/.arduino15 /media/vaibhav/Local\ Disk/arduino_backup/
Create Symbolic Link:

bash
Copy code
ln -s /media/vaibhav/Local\ Disk/arduino_backup/.arduino15 /home/vaibhav/.arduino15
Verify the Move and Link
Check the Contents:

Ensure that the .arduino15 directory and its contents are now in /media/vaibhav/Local Disk/arduino_backup/.
bash
Copy code
ls /media/vaibhav/Local\ Disk/arduino_backup/.arduino15
Check the Symbolic Link:

Verify that the symbolic link is working correctly.
bash
Copy code
ls -l /home/vaibhav/.arduino15
This should show a link pointing to /media/vaibhav/Local Disk/arduino_backup/.arduino15.
Clean Up
After verifying that everything works correctly, you can start using your system as usual. Your applications should continue to function without any issues, but now with more space available on your root filesystem (/dev/sdb5).

By following these steps, you effectively move the space-consuming .arduino15 directory to a different partition with ample space, freeing up your root filesystem.








































└─$ mkdir -p /media/vaibhav/Local\ Disk/arduino_backup

mkdir: cannot create directory ‘/media/vaibhav/Local Disk/arduino_backup’: Read-only file system

ChatGPT
The "Read-only file system" error suggests that your external drive or partition /media/vaibhav/Local Disk is mounted in read-only mode. This can happen for several reasons, such as file system corruption or mounting the file system as read-only by default.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Remount the File System as Read-Write
Unmount the File System:

Unmount the file system if it is currently mounted.
bash
Copy code
sudo umount /media/vaibhav/Local\ Disk
Remount with Read-Write Permissions:

Remount the file system with read-write permissions. Replace /dev/sda5 with the correct device identifier if necessary.
bash
Copy code
sudo mount -o rw /dev/sda5 /media/vaibhav/Local\ Disk
Verify Mount Options:

Ensure the file system is now mounted with read-write permissions.
bash
Copy code
mount | grep '/media/vaibhav/Local\ Disk'
2. Check and Repair the File System (if necessary)
If the above steps don't work, there may be file system issues that need to be repaired.

Unmount the File System:

bash
Copy code
sudo umount /dev/sda5
Check and Repair:

Use fsck to check and repair the file system. Replace /dev/sda5 with the correct device identifier.
bash
Copy code
sudo fsck -y /dev/sda5
Remount with Read-Write Permissions:

After the repair, remount the file system.
bash
Copy code
sudo mount -o rw /dev/sda5 /media/vaibhav/Local\ Disk
Steps to Move .arduino15 After Remounting
Once the file system is mounted with read-write permissions, proceed with moving the .arduino15 directory:

Create the Backup Directory:

bash
Copy code
mkdir -p /media/vaibhav/Local\ Disk/arduino_backup
Move the .arduino15 Directory:

bash
Copy code
mv /home/vaibhav/.arduino15 /media/vaibhav/Local\ Disk/arduino_backup/
Create a Symbolic Link:

bash
Copy code
ln -s /media/vaibhav/Local\ Disk/arduino_backup/.arduino15 /home/vaibhav/.arduino15
Example Commands
Unmount and Remount with Read-Write Permissions:

bash
Copy code
sudo umount /media/vaibhav/Local\ Disk
sudo mount -o rw /dev/sda5 /media/vaibhav/Local\ Disk
Check and Repair (if necessary):

bash
Copy code
sudo umount /dev/sda5
sudo fsck -y /dev/sda5
sudo mount -o rw /dev/sda5 /media/vaibhav/Local\ Disk
Create Backup Directory and Move .arduino15:

bash
Copy code
mkdir -p /media/vaibhav/Local\ Disk/arduino_backup
mv /home/vaibhav/.arduino15 /media/vaibhav/Local\ Disk/arduino_backup/
Create Symbolic Link:

bash
Copy code
ln -s /media/vaibhav/Local\ Disk/arduino_backup/.arduino15 /home/vaibhav/.arduino15
By following these steps, you should be able to remount your external drive with read-write permissions and move the .arduino15 directory without encountering the "Read-only file system" error.
